Jupyter notebook used for basic integrate-and-fire neural model exploration. Simply click the above link to run the notebook online, or follow the setup guide below to get up and running offline.

## Open online

The script is provided as a Jupyter notebook which can be opened online using
[Google's colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) service. Simply
click the colab button above.

## Offline setup

Ensure you have these dependencies installed on your system: [python3](https://www.python.org/) (tested on 3.11), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (should be installed with Python). Everything else (jupyter, pandas, etc) will be installed automatically below.
